# Predictive modeling with supervised machine learning {#supervisedLearning} 
In this chapter we will introduce supervised machine learning applications for predictive modeling. In genomics, we are often faced a couple biological questions to answer using lots of data. Some of those questions can easily fit in the domain of machine learning, where algorithms will learn a mathematical model of the input data in order to make decisions about similar data, previously unseen by the model. Often we are trying to predict a medical or biological variable of interest using molecular signatures obtained via genomics methods. To give you a better idea, we listed some of the machine learning applications in genomics:
